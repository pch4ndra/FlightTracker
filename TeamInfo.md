## Project Summary

This project is a flight tracker that records the amount of emissions released from each flight on each journey. We start off by recording the information of each passenger and what flight they chose. Furthemore, we record the departures and arrivals of each flight to show the flight paths and record the distances that the passengers will travel. Also, we also have information about the tickets that they bought and how much they costed. From all of this, we will be able to calculate the most efficient and the most cheapest flights that a passenger may choose. 


This project is extremely helpful for passengers as they can use this information to make the environmentally conscious decision of what flight to choose for their trip. In 2013, according to the International Council on Clean Transportation, global CO2 emission from commercial aviation was 707 million tons in 2013 and in 2019, that value reached 920 million tons. This is a 30% increase in just six years. Along with the rising problem of global warming, we have to take steps in order to solve this issue. And to do so, people have to be either flying less often or choose a more efficient flight that gets them to their destination. With this project, we will be able to help passengers take great strides in helping our planet thrive.
