# Project Proposal
1. We will store data for Airports, Passengers, Airlines, Planes (with MPG of each plane), the flights from location to destination, and the tickets themselves. We will get airport, airline, and plane data from online resources to get real data on how much fuel is used. However, passenger data will be autogenerated as it is not essential for our project that passenger data be reflective of real data. Flight data will also be autogenerated based on how many passengers and flights each airports serve per year. We will try to be reflective of the proportions of data from real airports. The ticket data will also be randomly generated based on how many tickets an airline usually sells for each flight.
2. The basic functions of our web application would show how much fuel each airline buys at each airport and a comparison of each airline and how much fuel they buy compared to how many passengers they serve.
3. We would try to develop a map of what are the top flight paths in the US. We will use our data and use python mapping to show busy flight paths as red and not common paths as green. This would be an interesting feature for airlines to use to see what paths they should put more flights on and what paths they can save some money on.
## Proposal
1. **Project Title**: FlightAnalyzer
2. **Project Summary**: This project is a flight tracker that records the amount of emissions released from each flight on each journey. We start off by recording the information of each passenger and what flight they chose. Furthemore, we record the departures and arrivals of each flight to show the flight paths and record the distances that the passengers will travel. Also, we also have information about the tickets that they bought and how much they costed. From all of this, we will be able to calculate the most efficient and the most cheapest flights that a passenger may choose. This project is extremely helpful for passengers as they can use this information to make the environmentally conscious decision of what flight to choose for their trip. In 2013, according to the International Council on Clean Transportation, global CO2 emission from commercial aviation was 707 million tons in 2013 and in 2019, that value reached 920 million tons. This is a 30% increase in just six years. Along with the rising problem of global warming, we have to take steps in order to solve this issue. And to do so, people have to be either flying less often or choose a more efficient flight that gets them to their destination. With this project, we will be able to help passengers take great strides in helping our planet thrive.
3. **Project Description**: We want to be able to analyze the flight data in US airspace and see how efficient airlines are being with their flights. This efficiency would be calculated by seeing gallons of oil as a measure of how many passengers are served. We are also able to see how inefficient airlines are with how they plan flights to less common airports. This data analyzation will help make a dent in the fight against global warming and help airlines make a larger profit on their flights as well.
4. **Usefulness**: There are websites out their that track flights and amount of passengers, etc. But there is no clear database or app out their that clearly shows how much fuel is being used. Our app will be useful because it will be one of the first ones to show how we can use less fuel, make a better impact in the fight against global warming meanwhile showing airlines how they could be more profitable too.
5. **Realness**: We will get airport, airline, and plane data from online resources to get real data on how much fuel is used. However, passenger data will be autogenerated as it is not essential for our project that passenger data be reflective of real data. Flight data will also be autogenerated based on how many passengers and flights each airports serve per year. We will try to be reflective of the proportions of data from real airports. The ticket data will also be randomly generated based on how many tickets an airline usually sells for each flight.
6. **Functionality**: The user will be able to search every datapoint and relation in the table, they can also run simulations to see how the averages and data would change if they could add their mock data. Thus, they would be able to insert, delete, and update date based on how they want to run their simulation.
7. **UI mockup**:

9. **Project tasks**: We will all develop the website framework together. This will be extensive as Pranav and Prithvi will work together to get the graphs up and running. Sahith will have to develop the simulations tab where users will be able to interact with the database and see how the graphs change based on their edits. Pranav and Sahith will be in charge and randomly generating data, and Sahith and Prithvi will be responsible for getting the from online and sorting the data into how we want to store it.
